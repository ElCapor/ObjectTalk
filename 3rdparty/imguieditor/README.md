This version is based on https://github.com/santaclose/ImGuiColorTextEdit which is a fork of https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit.

The original version hasn't been updated in 4 years and as a result, there are many forks. The santaclose fork is the most promising but it is going through active development and backwards compatibility and stability is sometimes an issue. This is why we keep a private version here to protect ourselves and keep things going.

A repository based on the code here is available at https://github.com/goossens/ImGuiColorTextEdit. This allows easier difference tracking with the santaclose version.
