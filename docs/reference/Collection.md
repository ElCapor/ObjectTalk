# Collection Class

The Collection class is an abstract class without any functionality derived
from [Object](Object.md). The purpose of it in ObjectTalk is simply to
group all collection classes and to provide a common base class for them.

[Arrays](Array.md) [Dictionaries](Dict.md) and [Sets](Set.md)
are derived from this class.
