ObjectTalk has a large number of primitives or geometries. Geometries are
generally 3D shapes that are generated at runtime with a bunch of parameters.

It's common to use geometries for things like a sphere for a globe or a
bunch of boxes to draw a 3D graph. It's especially common to use geometries
to experiment and get started with 3D. For the majority of 3D apps it's more
common to have an artist make 3D models in a 3D modeling program like Blender or Maya or Cinema 4D. These models can also be loaded in as
geometries but later you will see that complex models can also be loaded
complete with their own materials. For now let's go over some of the
available geometries.

Many of the geometries below have defaults for some or all of their parameters so you can use more or less depending on your needs. For
each geometry supported by ObjectTalk, a small test program is available
in the examples folder (examples/3d/geometries). These little programs
allow you to play with the parameters of a geometry so you can see
the effect life.
