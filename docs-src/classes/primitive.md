The Primitive class is an abstract class without any functionality derived
from [Object](Object.md). The purpose of it in ObjectTalk is simply to
group all primitive classes and to provide a common base class for them.

[Booleans](Boolean.md), [Integers](Integer.md), [Reals](Real.md),
[Strings](String.md) and [Functions](Function.md) are derived from this
class.
